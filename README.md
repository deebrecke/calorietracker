# calorietracker
JavaScript Calculator for determining calories burned doing different exercises.
This caluclator asks user for weight in pounds and converts it to kilograms.
Then the user selects an activity from a drop-down menu and the program outputs the "MET's" (metabolic equivalent of task) for that activity.
Finally, it auto-fills the kilograms and mets to the third section and outputs the calories burned per minute.
There is an extra .js file in here because I kept my original code when I changed from if/else statement to a switch statement. "switch.js is the code that is running in the output console.
